This was an assignment that gave us a chance to upgrade one of our previous assignments from the beginning of the bootcamp program. I can honestly say that I have learned a LOT from this program so far. Most of my coding examples may not show the skills I have learned to the best of my ability but I am having a blast trying to figure everything out! Most assignments have been difficult and this assignment was no different. On one end we are just upgrading work that has already been done but on the other end of the spectrum we are also able to freely express ourselves with everything that we have learned so far. I do believe this is where my mind comes to a halt as the ideas that I have to be creative are unlimited...it's just choosing the best plan of action and going with it.

But with all of that being said everything that is needed to make this project work is already laid out for you. The pages are linked together and this is also going to be a definite work in progress. The more I learn the more I am able to incorporate into my coding.The javascript and style files can be located in the assets/ folder. There is not too much code (if any) in the javascript file as I decided to go the old route of using html and css. I will be using Javascript in the page at a later date but for now I am trying to get used to using a different css template that is NOT bootstrap so there's that.

I had a few issues getting some of my images to become mobile friendly so in order to get them to stay on the page ABOVE the footer after the page shrunk in size I made the images a little bit smaller. This however made the images smaller and not take up as much space when desktop mode is enabled. There will be an incoming fix for that soon as well! The main home page is missing a little bit of things but that is also a quick fix as I spent the majority of my time playing around with the new style template. Hopefully the page makes a little bit of sense to you as you examine it and ANY kind of help would be appreciated! Thanks in advance and pleasure to meet you!
